This is work in progress. ðŸ¤–

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to read changelogs.
After a deployment, the changelog is automatically sent to a AWS lambda function (dealer-write) which parses and then stores it in a dynamoDB table.
Another lambda (dealer-read) does the work of notifying that the slack slash command was reveived which is then pushed as a AWS SNS. The SNS invokes the interpreting lambda (angelbot), which after understanding the slash command, reads the changelog table and lastly sends the asked information to the slack channel.
